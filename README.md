## Getting Started

This is a Flutter application. To run it:

1. Ensure you have Flutter installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
4. Run `flutter run` to start the application

## Run Instructions (with Drift + Riverpod + GoRouter)

Follow these steps for a clean setup across platforms:

1) Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (stable channel)
- Xcode (for iOS/macOS) and/or Android Studio (for Android)
- Cocoapods for iOS: `sudo gem install cocoapods`

2) Install dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3) Generate Drift code
```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

4) Platform setup
- iOS/macOS:
  - From the project root: `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`
- Android: no extra steps typically required

5) Run the app
```bash
flutter run
```

Notes
- The app uses ProviderScope in `main.dart` and initializes Flutter bindings before runApp; no additional steps needed.
- If you change database tables, re-run build_runner.
- For hot-reload driven changes that modify generated code, use: `dart run build_runner watch -d`.
